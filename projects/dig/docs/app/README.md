# DigApps

## [Configuration](https://github.com/dig-platform/dig-app/tree/main/projects/dig/docs/app/config.md)

DigApps are configuration driven, which makes integration and extension as easy as possible.

## [User authentication](https://github.com/dig-platform/dig-app/tree/main/projects/dig/docs/app/auth.md)

You can optionally load an authentication adapter which will load the auth state from a wide range of providers into your DigApp.

## [Database](https://github.com/dig-platform/dig-app/tree/main/projects/dig/docs/app/auth.md)

At the time of writing we only support Firebase Firestore, but you can use our generic adapter to integrate with other data sources.

## [File Storage](https://github.com/dig-platform/dig-app/tree/main/projects/dig/docs/app/auth.md)

At the time of writing we only support Firebase Storage, but you can use our generic adapter to integrate with other data sources.

## [State](https://github.com/dig-platform/dig-app/tree/main/projects/dig/docs/app/auth.md)
